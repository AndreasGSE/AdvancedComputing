The two R scripts for the homework.

The data generated by the first one was thought of and implemented by me (no extra resources used). It creates a set of points for each category - where each set of data has two "peaks" in it. Then, for each category, the data is "rotated". This means the data for each category will cross one another and no simple, linear division can be made. 

It only works for 2D, but the mean of the data, covariance matrix and number of categories can all be modified (and number of data points).


The second produces the category problem for 3 categories normally. The data generated is in three clumps and divded accordingly.
